To fully understand and contribute to this project, you should be familiar with the following JavaScript concepts:

- `document.querySelector()` â€“ for selecting and manipulating DOM elements.
- `Math.random()` â€“ to generate a random number for the coin flip.
- `Math.floor()` â€“ to round the random number to 0 or 1.
- `addEventListener()` â€“ for handling user interaction.
- conditionals
- **Functions** â€“ to organize the logic of the game into reusable blocks.
- **Iterator / Loop** â€“ for potential features like multiple flips or animations.

## ðŸš€ Advanced

Once the basic functionality is working, consider adding the following enhancements:

- Add a flip animation using CSS or JavaScript.
- Track and display win percentages.
